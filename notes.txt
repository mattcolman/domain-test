NOTES:

Cannot use css grid due to IE10

reasons I like styled-components.
- removes css obscurities such as order of classnames
- removes issue of global css conflicts
- visually see the component is one file
- composability

- form validation will come from the backend, however we could also add some frontend validation.
for example validating a valid email address.

- we could add an autocomplete to the Country field to select from all countries in the world, but this information
would also come from the backend.

- Should use a ThemeProvider
